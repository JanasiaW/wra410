# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Dark Gray is more appealing makes the content comes to life.

2. Times New Roman is more professional.

3. I included the code picture because this is what the class is about, I decide to had a visual. A picture of the professor just to know who is our professor.

4. Added a border to the grading scale to look more professional

5. I use MSU green to continue the theme. I added the same red from the nav bar to make the groups more appealing. I used jobs within XA to create a creative touch to the page.
6.  Added a nav bar to the left of the schedule page so the format can stay consistent.

7. I added white and gray as a background to give it a clear and prettier look.
